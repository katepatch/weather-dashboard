# Weather Dashboard

This project uses a Third-party API and calls specific paramaters from the URL. This weather dashboard uses the Open Weather API and calls for current temps, humidity, wind speed, and UV-index.  It also calls for a 5 day forecast with those same paramaters.</br>
This project also uses local storage to store previous searches and allows you to click on a previous city and bring up its current weather conditions.</br>
